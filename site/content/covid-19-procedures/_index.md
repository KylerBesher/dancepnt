Hello PNT families, 

As we welcome all dancers and families to our events this season, we want to share some of our covid-19 safety precautions in place.

1.  Whenever possible, our studio block scheduling will allow studios to compete one at a time and leave immediately following their performance. 
2.  Events will be live streamed to limit the need for spectators. We ask that no more than 1 spectator accompany each dancer. 
3.  Whenever possible entrance doors will be locked to ensure only studio fans can enter the venue. 
4.  When Mandated by local authorities, everyone will be required to wear face masks indoors. If you have a medical condition that exempts you from this, please let us know and be prepared to provide a doctors note. In order to reduce touch points, doors will be propped open, and hand sanitizer stations will be available throughout the venue. 
5.  Signs and flyers will be posted to promote social distancing and safety procedures. 
6.  Between each studio, PNT members will clean and sanitize the dressing rooms, stage, doors, and all touch points. 
7.  To help with crowd control, our official merchandise can be purchased via our website, and picked up on site. 
8.  Digital programs, Photos and Video, will be available on our website. 
9.  Our in person award ceremonies will also be limited to one studio at a time and will consist of adjudications and any other recognition awards. Overall awards will be live streamed following the event. 
10. PNT team members will have temperatures taken daily and will wear face masks at all times. We will continue to follow state and federal guidelines to ensure the health and safety of everyone.

Dancers we are so excited to have you join us this season. We cannot wait to see you soon!
